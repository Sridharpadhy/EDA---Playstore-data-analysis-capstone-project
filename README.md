# EDA---Playstore-data-analysis-capstone-project
This the capstone project about the play store app dataset then it has been cleaned , wrangled , manipulated  and made ready for the analysis which is then used for answer many observation by visualization tools. 





Conculsion::

- With more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be an important distribution platform to build a global audience. This makes the hell lot of competition in App market.

- And also we can say that before starting any kind of exploration the data cleaning play a vital role in result and accuracy.

- As we all can see the many observations and conclusion that arise from the data visualization and how visualizations make anything interesting with the graphs, plots, chart or maps.

- Which simplify the data and can be easily understand the role of the data and their elements in the diverse world of play store.

- As per the graphs visualizations shown above, most of the trending apps (in terms of users' installs) are from the categories like GAME, COMMUNICATION, and TOOL even though the amount of available apps from these categories are twice as much lesser than the category FAMILY. The trending of these apps is most probably due to their nature of being able to entertain or assist the user. Besides, it also shows a good trend where we can see that developers from these categories are focusing on the quality instead of the quantity of the apps.

- Other then this also can be say that mostly the app has higher number of user installs or review gives the app a good rating and mostly all the apps are around the rating of 4 (8000 apps).Also the size and price of the app create a minute difference but not majorly effect the app with good rating, review even if their app size are high. But due to free in charges we get the higher number of user installs and ratings.

- Also, it can be seen from the chart that the sentiments play important role and maximum number of sentiment which are positive around (64.1 %) lies between subjectivity 0.4 to 0.7. From this, we can conclude that the maximum number of the audience give reviews to the applications, according to their experience.

As, we can see that, why exploring data is important before starting to build ML models.
As a conclusion, we learnt that the current trends in the Android market are mostly from these categories which assisting, communicating or entertaining apps.
